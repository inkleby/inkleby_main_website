Fees for the first sets of councils are up on [Letting Fees UK](http://lettingfees.co.uk) - our letting fee comparison project we've been building with Generation Rent.

Letting Fees UK is a combination display and crowdsourcing platform. It's designed to make it easy for transparency volunteers to add details of the fees charged by letting agents into the system (and also includes feature to help organisers error check this work).

Once the information is in the system, it channels it in a way that makes prices clearer to renters and help local authorities enforce disclosure rules. [Have a look!](http://lettingfees.co.uk)
