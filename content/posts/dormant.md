Title: Dormancy

Just a quick note to cap off this website for the moment. 

I'm not anticipating any new projects appearing here in the near future - I took a role at [mySociety](https://www.mysociety.org/author/alexparsons/) as a Research Associate six months ago, and this was recently extended for another year. So Inkleby as my professional brand is probably going to be dormant for a little while. 

[StringPrint](http://www.stringprint.com) is something I will be tinkering with because I'm still deeply frustrated with many aspects of web publishing. Various other projects may be recycled in exciting new forms.

I'm continuing to collaborate with Generation Rent on [lettingfees.co.uk](http://www.lettingfees.co.uk) (which, with the best of luck, will become obsolute in the not-too-long).
