New Robot! The [Culture Reuse Bot](https://twitter.com/CultureReuseBot) downloads old public domain films from the internet archive and tries to find interesting bits to share. 

What is interesting? Specifically it looks for shots that are reasonably short and reasonably bright on the grounds those are likely to be visually nice. There is also a better chance they contain atomisable elements of a performance that make the clip interesting even out context.

Hopefully. Sometimes.

It  updates [a tumblr](http://culturereuse.tumblr.com/) as well as its [twitter]((https://twitter.com/CultureReuseBot)). 

All code for Inkleby Robots can be found on [the github](https://github.com/inkleby/inklebyrobots) page.
